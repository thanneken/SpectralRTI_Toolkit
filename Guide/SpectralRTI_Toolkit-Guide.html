<h2 id="installation">Software installation</h2>
<p>All the software required for SpectralRTI processing is freely available. Status of operating system compatibility is as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Windows 10:</b> Fully tested and compatible</li>
	<li><b>Linux:</b> Fully tested, requires Wine to run HSHfitter and webGLRtiMaker</li>
	<li><b>MacOS:</b> Needs testing, expected compatibility with all components except optional webGLRtiMaker <a href="volunteer.html"><span class="volunteer">Volunteers needed</span></a></li>
</ul>
<h3>ImageJ</h3>
<p>ImageJ is an open-source image processing suite originated by the National Institutes of Health. It is well suited to scientific and medical imaging applications. </p>
<p>Fiji (Fiji Is Just Imagej) is a distribution of ImageJ that includes additional plugins. Although the extra plugins required for the SpectralRTI_Toolkit can be downloaded separately, we recommend starting with the Fiji distribution.</p>
<p>ImageJ and Fiji require Java, which can be downloaded together with the installer if it is not already installed on your system.</p>
<p>Resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fiji installer download page <a href="https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads">https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>SpectralRTI_Toolkit</h3>
<p>The SpectralRTI_Toolkit is currently available as a macro for ImageJ. The Saint Louis University Center for Digital Humanities is currently developing the Toolkit into a plugin written in Java which should reduce memory requirements and increase speed.</p>
<p>Download the following files from <a href="https://github.com/thanneken/SpectralRTI_Toolkit">https://github.com/thanneken/SpectralRTI_Toolkit</a></p>
<ol>
	<li><code>SpectralRTI_Toolkit.ijm</code> and copy to the <code>macros</code> folder under ImageJ or Fiji</li>
	<li><code>ijp-toolkit_bin_2.1.0.zip</code> and unzip to the <code>plugins</code> folder under ImageJ or Fiji (required for all options)</li>
	<li><code>bij_plugin.zip</code> and unzip to the <code>plugins</code> folder under ImageJ or Fiji (required for Principal Component Analysis, which is required for Extended Spectrum and PCA Pseudocolor)</li>
	<li>For ImageJ but not Fiji, <code>Stack_Manipulation-2.0.1.zip</code> and unzip to the <code>plugins</code> folder under ImageJ (required for Extended Spectrum and PCA Pseudocolor)</li>
</ol>
<h3>RTIBuilder</h3>
<p>The RTIBuilder distributed by Cultural Heritage Imaging is the best way to create an LP file (unless you already have one) and also includes the HSHfitter required for creating RTI files.</p>
<p>Windows and MacOS installers are available from <a href="http://culturalheritageimaging.org/What_We_Offer/Downloads/Process/index.html">http://culturalheritageimaging.org/What_We_Offer/Downloads/Process/index.html</a>. For Linux, download and extract either version (e.g., <code>7z x RTIbuilder_2_0_2.dmg</code>). The application can be run from a terminal shell by changing to the directory that contains <code>RTIbuilder.jar</code> and entering the command <code>java -jar RTIbuilder.jar</code></p> 
<p>The SpectralRTI_Toolkit will prompt when it is time to run RTIBuilder to create an LP file. See below, "Light position data" <a class="small" href="#lpdata">(LINK)</a></p>
<h3>Optional Jpeg2000 encoding for IIIF Image servers</h3>
<p>The Toolkit will give the option of creating "Static Raking" images. "Static" contrasts with dynamically relightable RTI images. "Raking" means any angle of light among the hemisphere captures. Utilizing this option avoids lossy jpeg encoding (currently required for RTI) and creates files ready for IIIF Image repositories (tiled and layered). To utilize this feature it is necessary to download a jpeg2000 encoder. The best available is Kakadu. The executables for Windows, MacOS, and Linux can be downloaded from <a href="http://kakadusoftware.com/downloads/">http://kakadusoftware.com/downloads/</a>.</p>
<h3>Optional WebRTI</h3>
<p>To prepare RTI files for WebRTI you will need <code>webGLRTIMaker.exe</code> from <a href="http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/rti/webviewer.php">http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/rti/webviewer.php</a>.</p>

<h2 id="input">Managing input data</h2>
<p>Data captured by the Jubilees Palimpsest Project is available online for testing the Toolkit prior to application on your own data. The file <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thanneken/SpectralRTI_Toolkit/master/SpectralRTI_Dataset.bash"><code>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thanneken/SpectralRTI_Toolkit/master/SpectralRTI_Dataset.bash</code></a> can be run directly from a bash terminal in Linux or Windows. Running on MacOS may require replacing <code>wget</code> with <code>curl</code>, or you could download the files listed manually.</p> 
<h3>Folder structure</h3>
<p>It is strictly necessary that no spaces appear anywhere in the file paths.</p>
<p>The Toolkit assumes that all input files are in the tiff format. Some adaptation to the Toolkit may be necessary to use other formats supported by ImageJ.</p>
<p>The Toolkit is indifferent to filenames but requires precise folder names to identify components. Each image set (e.g., page) requires a project folder (e.g. "Figurine" in the sample data set) and several subfolders, as follows:</p>
<ol>
	<li><code>AccurateColor</code> (required for accurate color images, strongly recommended)</li>
	<li><code>Captures-Fluorescence-NoGamma</code> (can be used for PCA Pseudocolor, optional)</li>
	<li><code>Captures-Hemisphere-Gamma</code> (required)</li>
	<li><code>Captures-Narrowband-NoGamma</code> (required for Extended Spectrum, can be used for PCA Pseudocolor, recommended)</li>
	<li><code>Captures-Transmissive-Gamma</code> (if more than one file is in the folder the user will be prompted to select one, optional)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Rotation</h3>
<p>There is not a good way to rotate RTI files after they are created so data should be rotated at this point, if necessary.</p>

<h2 id="firstrun">Running for the first time</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Start ImageJ</li>
	<li>Plugins > Macros > Install..., then find and select <code>SpectralRTI_Toolkit.ijm</code> (see "Tips for frequent use" for how to add the Toolkit to Startup Macros)</li>
	<li>Plugins > Macros > Spectral RTI [n1] (or press 1 on the keyboard number pad)</li>
</ol>
<p class="prompt"><b>Consult Preferences</b> <br>The following settings are remembered from the configuration file or a previous run. Edit or clear as desired.</p>
<p>This will be empty on the first run and subsequently will allow you to review settings that are not frequently changed.</p>
<p class="prompt"><b>Choose a directory</b></p>
<p>Locate the project directory folder that contains the sub-folders Captures-Hemisphere-Gamma, etc.</p>

<h2 id="selecttasks">Select tasks</h2>
<p class="prompt"><b>Select Tasks</b> <br>Select the tasks you would like to complete</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Light Position Data</b> Use this option to create the Light Position (lp) files necessary for RTI. Selected by default unless an LP file is detected in the <code>LightPositionData</code> subdirectory.</li>
	<li><b>Accurate ColorRTI</b> Use this option to create an RTI file from the image in the <code>AccurateColor</code> subdirectory.</li>
	<li><b>Accurate Color Static Raking</b> Use this option to create static raking images from the image in the <code>AccurateColor</code> subdirectory. This will create tiled and layered Jpeg2000 files for IIIF image repositories without subjecting the data to lossy encoding.</li>
	<li><b>Extended Spectrum RTI</b> Use this option to create an RTI file from the Extended Spectrum <a class="small" href="glossary.html">(GLOSSARY)</a> processing of the narrowband captures.</li>
	<li><b>Extended Spectrum Static Raking</b> As above, use this option to create non-RTI images for a IIIF repository.</li>
	<li><b>Pseudocolor RTI</b> Use this option to create an RTI file from PCA Pseudocolor <a class="small" href="glossary.html">(GLOSSARY)</a> processing of the narrowband captures.</li>
	<li><b>Pseudocolor Static Raking</b>  As above, use this option to create non-RTI images for a IIIF repository.</li>
	<li><b>Custom RTI</b> Use this option to create an RTI file from an image created in external software such as ENVI.</li>
	<li><b>Custom Static Raking</b> As above, use this option to create non-RTI images for a IIIF repository.</li>
	<li><b>WebRTI</b> Use this option to derive tiles for WebRTI from the RTI files created above.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="brightness">Adjust brightness</h2>
<p class="prompt"><b>Adjust brightness of hemisphere captures?</b>
<br>Adjust brightness of hemisphere captures?</p>
<p class="note">Note: this dialog needs to be rewritten for greater clarity</p>
<p>The hemisphere captures use the same exposure settings for all light positions, which is valuable for rendering RTI images, but leaves the static raking images too dark.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>No</b> Use this option if brightness of the hemisphere captures is good for RTI and you do not want static raking images (or don't mind them being dark)</li> 
	<li><b>Yes, by normalizing each image to a selected area</b> Use this option if the brightness of the hemisphere captures is good for RTI but the static raking images should be brighter.</li>
	<li><b>Yes, by multiplying all images by a fixed value</b> Use this option if the hemisphere captures are too dark even for RTI.</li>
</ul>
<p class="prompt">Apply adjustment to which output images?</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Static Raking images only (recommended)</b> Use this option if the hemisphere captures have the good brightness for RTI.</li>
	<li><b>RTI images also</b> Use this option if the hemisphere captures should be adjusted for brightness before RTI.</li>
</ul>
<p class="prompt"><b>Select area</b> <br>Draw a rectangle containing the brightest white and darkest black desired then press OK (hint: use a large area including spectralon and the object, excluding glare)</p>
<p class="note">Note: rewrite dialog to read "hint: exclude glare but include the darkest black and whitest white, typically on the color checker chart"</p>
<p>This option appears if "normalizing each image to a selected area" was chosen on the previous dialog.</p>
<p class="note">Go back and document interaction if "multiplying all images by a fixed value" was selected.</p>
<h2 id="staticraking">Static raking option</h2>
<p class="prompt"><b>Select light positions</b> <br>Select light positions for static raking images</p>
<p>This option appears if "Static Raking" was selected under "Select Tasks" previously.</p>
<p>The prompt will list the images found in the <code>Captures-Hemisphere-Gamma</code> directory. Typically one might want low angles from four directions, minimally impacted by shadow from the copy stand. When using the MegaVision Arc for RTI the positions A03, A13, G05, and G13 are good choices.</p>
<h2 id="extendedspectrum">Options for Extended Spectrum</h2>
<p class="prompt"><b>Assign Narrowband Captures</b> <br>Assign each narrowband capture to the visible range of R, G, B, or none</p>
<p>This option appears if "Extended Spectrum" was selected under "Select Tasks" previously.</p>
<p>The prompt will list the images found in the <code>Captures-Narrowband-NoGamma</code> directory. The default options should work well if the filenames sort from shortest to longest wavelength. Roughly a third of the images with the shortest wavelengths should be assigned to the B (blue) category, the middle wavelengths to the G (green) category, and the longest to R (red) category. Use "none" if that image should not be used for Extended Spectrum processing.</p>
<h2 id="roi">Identify region of interest (for Extended Spectrum and Pseudocolor)</h2>
<p class="prompt"><b>Select area</b> <br>Draw a rectangle containing the colors of interest for PCA (hint: limit to object or smaller)</p>
<p>Situations and opinions differ with respect to how small the rectangle should be (e.g., should it include overtext), but it is at least clear that it should exclude non-artifact distractions such as the color checker chart.</p>
<h2 id="pcapseudocolor">Options for PCA Pseudocolor</h2> 
<p class="prompt"><b>Select sources for Pseudocolor</b> <br>Pseudocolor images require two sources images (typically principal component images). <br>Method:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Generate and select using defaults</b> This option automatically uses the second and third principal components for the pseudocolor, which is often enough the best choice if the area for PCA analysis was well chosen.</li>
	<li><b>Generate and manually select two</b> This will (later) require the user to go through a stack of principal component images and delete all but the two slices that most elucidate the desired target.</li>
	<li><b>Open pregenerated images</b> This option takes a two-layer stack already generated in ImageJ or other software.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="custom">Options for custom processes</h2>
<p class="prompt"><b>Choose a source for Custom Process</b></p>
<p>SpectralRTI can also take chrominance information from any stack of one, two, or three layers. The image should be in a subdirectory under the project folder with any name (e.g., <code>CustomColor1</code>). </p>

<h2 id="lpdata">Light position data</h2>
<p class="prompt"><b>Select ROI</b> <br>Draw a rectangle loosely around a reflective hemisphere and press Ok</p>
<p class="note">The sequence is counter-intuitive here as a result of efforts to front-load interaction. Also, change dialog to "Select Area" to avoid jargon (Region of Interest). Also, capitalize OK for consistency.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of the process to create a Light Position (lp) file. Make sure the rectangle includes the entire reflective sphere.</p>
<p class="prompt"><b>Use RTI Builder to Create LP File</b> <br>Please use RTI Builder to create an LP file based on the reflective hemisphere detail images in [Project Directory\LightPositionData\ <br>Press cancel to discontinue Spectral RTI Toolkit or Ok to continue with other tasks after the lp file has been created.</p>
<p>Leave this window alone and start RTIBuilder (see above, Software installation)</p>
<p class="prompt"><b>RTIbuilder</b> <br>Project Name <br>Operation Sequence</p>
<p>Give the project any name (e.g., shinysphere) and select <code>Highlight Based (HSH Fitter)</code> for the operation sequence. Click <code>Start New Project</code></p>
<p>Click <code>Open Folder</code> and navigate to your Project directory and select the folder <code>LightPositionData</code>. Be sure to select that directory and not the parent directory or the <code>jpeg-exports</code> folder within it.</p>
<p>If the capture went well each image should have a highlight (glare spot) on it, but you have the option of deleting failed shots here. Then press <code>Next</code>.</p>
<p>Again, draw a rectangle around the sphere. Click <code>Add Area</code> then <code>Detect Spheres</code></p>
<p>The software tries to identify the center and radius of the sphere. Check by clicking on different images, especially "Median." If it is necessary to change the radius or center be sure to click <code>Set New Center</code> before <code>Next</code>.</p>
<p>Click <code>Highlight detection</code> and a red cross will appear where the software detected the highlight. Click <code>Next</code>
<p>If the field "HSH Fitter Location" is not already filled, click <code>Find</code> and navigate to the file HSHfitter. Take note of the location, as you will need it later.
<p>Click <code>Execute</code>. The software may return "Fitting Completed" or an error message, but it does not matter as long as the LP file was created. Close RTIbuilder and return to ImageJ.</p>
<p>At the prompt "Use RTI Builder to Create LP File" click <code>OK</code>. The processing will run for several minutes, depending on options selected.</p> 

<h2 id="locatefitter">Locate Fitter</h2>
<p class="prompt"><b>Locate Preferred RTI Fitter or cmd file for batch processing</b></p>
<p class="note">Note: needs testing on MacOS</p>
<p>The straightforward option is to direct the prompt to the path <code>RTIbuilder_v2_0_2\Fitters\HSHfitter\hshfitter.exe</code>. See "Use deferredbatch.cmd" under "Tips for frequent use" below for the advantages of deferring HSH fitting.</p> 
<p>This option does not change frequently so is remembered and set to default the next time the Toolkit runs.

<h2 id="locatewebrtimaker">Locate webGLRTIMaker.exe</h2>
<p>If not already downloaded at the installation stage (above), download <code>webGLRTIMaker.exe</code> from <a href="http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/rti/webviewer.php">http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/rti/webviewer.php</a>.</p>

<h2 id="locatecompress">Locate Jpeg2000 encoder</h2>
<p class="prompt">Locate kdu_compress or ojp_compress</p>
<p>If not already downloaded at the installation stage (above), download from <a href="http://kakadusoftware.com/downloads/">http://kakadusoftware.com/downloads/</a>, install, and point the Toolkit to the kdu_compress executable.</p>
<p class="note">There seems to be a bug such that it keeps asking for the kdu_compress executable for each image. This is annoying but only applies to the first run. The selection will be remembered on subsequent runs of the Toolkit.</p>

<h2 id="morepca">More options for PCA Pseudocolor</h2>
<p>After some processing, the next questions will pick up from the selection made for PCA Pseudocolor (skip at Select Tasks, Generate and select using defaults, Generate and manually select two, or Open pregenerated images).</p>
<p class="prompt"><b>Select area</b> Delete slices from the stack until two remain <br>(Hint: Image > Stacks > Delete Slice) <br>Enhance contrast as desired <br>Then press Ok</p>
<p class="note">Change prompt heading from "Select area" to "Reduce stack." Also, enhance contrast should be mentioned before delete.</p> 
<p>This results from the choice "Generate and manually select two"</p>
<p class="note">The other paths are more straightforward but should be documented nonetheless.</p>
<p>The area of interest for PCA selected previously should be automatically selected. Feel free to modify the area.</p>
<p>If the images are too dark are light (which is likely) use <code>Process > Enhance Contrast</code> and check <code>Process all slices</code>.</p>
<p>The number of slices in the stack is equal to the number of narrowband captures. The last few are typically all black. Delete those, then delete the least helpful slices until two remain. Hint: navigate through slices with the <code>,</code> and <code>.</code> keys, which could also be thought of as <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> without shift.</p> 

<h2 id="frequentuse">Tips for frequent use</h2>
<h3>Include SpectralRTI_Toolkit.ijm in Startup Macros</h3>
<p class="note">TBA, see documentation in Fiji and ImageJ</p>
<h3>Use deferredbatch.cmd</h3>
<p>Let HSHfitter and WebGLRtiMaker run in batches overnight.</p>
<p>You can save waiting by deferring the time-consuming HSH fitting process. This could also be helpful if you need or want to use multiple computers or operating systems. First, create a file named <code>deferredbatch.cmd</code>. Run the Toolkit and clear the selection for preferred fitter. When prompted to identify the fitter, point to the cmd file. Now the toolkit will add commands to the batch file rather than running the fitter. When you want to start the batch, execute the cmd file. If the HSH Fitter and WebGLRTIMaker (if desired) are not in your path you could add them in the operating system or as an initial command in the cmd file.</p> 
<h3>Reuse LP files</h3>

<p>When using a handheld flash a new LP file must be generated for each object (but not each color process). The beauty of a fixed dome or stable arc is that the LP file can be created once from a calibration sequence and reused. 
<p>Edit the LP file created from the calibration sequence and replace the file path up to the position identifier with the word "canonical." For example, the first few lines of a reusable LP file might read:</p>
<p><code>56
<br>canonical-A01_043.jpg 0.17889495 -0.9825294 0.05130836
<br>canonical-A03_044.jpg 0.46035585 -0.8594868 0.22215976
<br>canonical-A05_045.jpg 0.7653712 -0.56276625 0.31225163
<br>canonical-A07_046.jpg 0.90808934 -0.28366238 0.3080737
<br>canonical-A09_047.jpg 0.9675771 0.09901111 0.23236032</code></p>
<p>If some images are rotated (but the capture apparatus remains fixed) LP files appropriate for other rotations can be derived by switching columns and inverting values, as appropriate.</p> 
<p>For any project directory with the same light positions, simply create a sub-directory <code>LightPositionData</code> and copy the canonical lp file into the directory. </p>

<h2 id="next">What's next</h2>
<p>After processing with the SpectralRTI_Toolkit the last step is delivery to users. <a href="" class="small">(LINK TBA)</a></p>
